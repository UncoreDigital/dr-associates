              SEBI, India’s financial market regulator, created new rules for a
              special Social Stock Exchange (SSE) where social organizations can
              raise funds from the public. They introduced a new financial tool
              called the Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP) instrument. This tool
              lets people and companies “donate” money to social organizations
              listed on the exchange, without expecting any profit or money
              back.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, while this shows progress in social investing, there are
              important legal and practical problems with these new rules that
              need fixing. Let’s break down these issues in simple language.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>The Problem with ZCZP Instruments</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How ZCZP Works:</b> People and companies give money to social
                  organizations. This money is not an “investment” like buying a
                  stock. Instead, it's a donation; donors don’t get any interest
                  (profit) or their money back.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Why is this a Problem?</b> Most investors, especially large
                  institutions like banks or mutual funds, put money in the market
                  hoping to earn returns. Since ZCZPs offer no financial gain, very
                  few traditional investors will be interested.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Limited Appeal:</b> Because ZCZPs are like donations, they can’t
                  be bought and sold easily in the market. There’s little to no “liquidity”
                  (you can’t sell them if you need your money back), which also discourages
                  buyers.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Result: </b> This tool is great for charities but doesn't attract
                normal investors; hence, the market for these instruments remains
                small.
              </p>

              <li><b>Missing Investor Protection</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>In Regular Markets:</b> SEBI requires protections for buyers—like
                  the ability to sell their investment and safeguards against fraud.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>With ZCZP Instruments:</b> Since donors don’t get returns, the
                  usual protections and checks for investors aren’t there. Some legal
                  rules say that every tradable security must offer some value or
                  benefit to its holder, which ZCZPs don't provide.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Legal Tension</b> Because these instruments don’t provide financial
                  benefits, they may not fully comply with India's existing rules
                  for marketable securities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                <b>Risk of Fake Impact (Social-Washing and Greenwashing)</b>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>What is Social-Washing?</b> It's when an organization exaggerates
                  or lies about the positive impact they have just to attract donations.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Current Rules:</b> SEBI says organizations should report their
                  impact, but doesn’t always require third-party checking or strong
                  punishments for false claims.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Why is that an Issue?</b> Without strict checks, some organizations
                  can easily make fake claims without being caught or punished.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <li><b>Recommended Solutions</b></li>
              <p>
                The document suggests several ways to protect donors and make
                the SSE framework stronger:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Independent Audits:</b> Every social organization should have
                  their impact claims checked by independent, outside experts, not
                  just review their own work.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Penalties for Cheating:</b> If an organization lies about its
                  impact, it should be fined or punished, much like the rules for
                  companies listed on the normal stock market.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>NFRA Oversight:</b> The National Financial Reporting Authority
                  (NFRA) should monitor the financial records and impact reports
                  of organizations on the SSE to make sure the numbers are real and
                  trustworthy.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Learn from Europe:</b> Europe has strong rules where organizations
                  face large penalties for making false social or sustainability
                  claims. India should consider adopting similar strict rules, with
                  both careful verification and meaningful fines.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                <b>Why These Changes Are Important<b></b></b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Building Trust:</b> Donors and the public will only trust
                    the Social Stock Exchange if they believe that their money is
                    going where it’s promised and that the laws really protect against
                    fraud and scams.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Market Credibility:</b> With clear rules, regular checks,
                    and penalties for misuse, the SSE framework will attract more
                    genuine organizations, more donations and possibly even serious
                    investors in the long run.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <p>
                <b>In summary:</b><br />
                SEBI’s Social Stock Exchange is a great idea for helping social organizations
                raise money, but there are still big problems - like weak legal protections
                and a lack of strict checking of impact claims. Stronger rules, audits,
                and penalties are necessary to prevent fake claims and make the system
                truly effective.
